So I've been playing piano for a very long time, being self-taught and spending most of my time playing things I felt "comfortable" with, and doing all of it by ear. Recently I've realized that my playing would benefit alot from some music theory, and I've started going through [Michael New's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNBiLBQrKrnvwcVRD5fS8aA). I'm going to post my progress on this blog, since I feel it will make myself be more accountable, and I think I will learn better from documenting it.

## My Goals

- Understanding harmonics better
- Learning how to read sheet music
- Become more knowledgeable in the circle of fifths
- Become more efficient in utilizing music theory when creating my own music

## Basic triads

His course starts with [learning basic chords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y01jIorpeA), which involves basic minor and major triads. This was a necessary refresher for me. I've been feeling comfortable playing perfect fifths for a very long time, and since the only trouble comes to me when the root chord is *B* or *Bb*, it's probably not too much of a surprise.

The major and minor thirds are a little bit more difficult to grasp from a visual perspective, since you have two combinations for each third. The thing is, I realized that once I got the hang of the major thirds, it was easy to modify the chord by altering it with one half-step. 

I'm still in the process of getting comfortable thinking of a chord and playing it out quickly, and more advanced versions like diminished and augmented triads will come later down the line. 

Until next time!
